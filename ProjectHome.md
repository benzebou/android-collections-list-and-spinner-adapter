A project which provides a generic adapter for a Spinner or a ListView.

As data basis every java.util.Collection can be used.

It is also possible to provide a custom layout factory which will be used to create the layouts. Using this factory different types of layouts can be implemented (such as multi line items, items with images, etcâ€¦)

To demonstrate the features of the adapter a second project is provided which is using the CollectionsAdapter to display a Spinner and a ListView.

Feel free to reuse this library in your own projects.

See http://app-solut.com/blog/2011/06/a-generic-listview-and-spinner-adapter-for-java-collections for a small introduction into this library.
